# Restful-Users-App
The app consumes a restful web service and displays the data on a view. 
The data on the view gives more details in a profile screen. 
The profile screen has an imageview that allows use of camera to take a picture
which displays on the image view. 
Issues: 
1. The adapter is not parsing the data for the front view
2. There is still need to add action to load camera images for the profile picture on the user detail activity. 


ensure to download all required dependencies.
